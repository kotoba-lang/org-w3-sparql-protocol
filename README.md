# org-w3-sparql-protocol

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-w3-sparql-protocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-w3-sparql-protocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`sparql.<apex>` — the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)
HTTP wire surface for kotobase, wrapping [`kotoba-lang/sparql`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/sparql)'s
already-real EDN algebra around data materialized by
[`kotoba-lang/kotobase-query`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase-query)'s bridge.
This is the SPARQL row of ADR-2607172300 (`com-junkawasaki/root`, "kotobase
query-protocol extension"), the most tractable of four sibling query-protocol
repos in that batch (`datomic-client-shim`, `org-postgresql-wire`,
`org-opencypher-cypher`, `org-w3-sparql-protocol`) — most of the query engine
this repo needs already existed before it was written.

**Naming note**: the bare name `sparql` is already `kotoba-lang/sparql` (the
algebra library this repo depends on). SPARQL 1.1 Protocol is a W3C spec, so
this repo follows the org's existing `org-w3-*` reverse-domain convention
(`org-w3-webgpu`, `org-w3-did`).

## What this repo is (and isn't)

- **Is**: an HTTP transport (`GET`/`POST` + `Accept` negotiation) around
  `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s existing `select`/`ask` — plus the one piece that
  had to be built new: SPARQL QUERY-TEXT parsing (`kotoba-lang/sparql`
  intentionally ships no text-syntax parser, see its README — "a separate
  parser repo is the natural place for `SELECT ?s WHERE {...}` string
  syntax"). `kotobase.protocols.sparql.parser` is that parser, scoped
  strictly to translate text into the algebra `kotoba-lang/sparql` already
  implements — it adds **zero new query semantics**.
- **Isn't**: a new SPARQL engine, a full SPARQL 1.1 grammar implementation,
  or a place that extends `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra. Every algebra node
  the parser ever emits is one of the 8 `:sparql/op` shapes that repo's
  README documents.

## The integration decision: `materialize` + our own quad transform, not `bridge/q`

`kotobase-query`'s bridge offers `materialize` (`IStore` + collection keys →
an `arrangement.core` db), a set of access paths over that db, and `q`/`query`
(a Datomic-shaped `:find`/`:where` frontend). **This repo uses `materialize`
and `datoms`, and never `q`.** `kotoba-lang/sparql` already has its own
complete algebra (BGP/join/filter/union/optional/project/distinct/order-by/
slice) over a plain in-memory quad seq — routing every SPARQL query through
`arrangement.datalog` first would mean translating SPARQL algebra INTO Datalog
algebra and back for no benefit.

**This is the supported path, not a deviation from one.**
[ADR-2608039970](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2608039970-kotobase-base-is-the-datom-plane-not-datalog.edn)
(`com-junkawasaki/root`): what the query surfaces share is the **datom plane**
— `materialize` — not Datalog. `q` is one frontend over that plane and this
repo is another; they are peers. The ADR was written *from* this repo's
behaviour, which had been correct and undocumented since it landed. What was
missing was anything saying so, which left the one surface doing the right
thing looking like the odd one out.

`kotobase.protocols.sparql.quads/datoms->quads` takes every triple via
`bridge/datoms` and transforms each `{:s :p :o}` into an `rdf.core`-shaped RDF
quad (`{:subject :predicate :object}`, term maps `{:rdf/type :iri|:literal
:value ...}`) ready for `sparql.core/select`/`sparql.core/ask`. It used to
walk `(:spo db)` itself, because the bridge exposed no full-plane scan — a raw
index read, with nothing on the supported path to apply `visible?` for it.
`bridge/datoms` is that scan (kotoba-lang/kotobase-query#7), and using it puts
the predicate back where the plane is read rather than one layer above it.

**Doc-map keys and materialized entities become IRIs** (`kw->iri-string`:
`:users/u1` → `urn:kotobase:users/u1`, `:role` → `urn:kotobase:role`) so BGP
patterns can match them by structural equality. **Object-position values are
always literals**, never IRIs — this deliberately mirrors
`kotobase-query`'s own worked cross-collection-join example (a foreign-key
field like `:dept-key "d1"` is a plain string that joins against the target
entity's `:kotobase/key` literal, not an IRI reference) — see
`kotobase.protocols.sparql.quads`'s ns docstring for the full reasoning.

### `visible?` — required, on the scan and at our boundary

Every path into the plane requires an explicit `visible?` predicate
(ADR-2607050500, "query as first-class effect" — no permissive default), and
that now includes the scan itself: `bridge/datoms` refuses a missing or
non-callable predicate before reading anything. `datoms->quads` keeps its own
check as well — it is this repo's error, with this repo's message, at this
repo's boundary, and the two agree rather than one standing in for the other.
It takes `visible?` as a **required** argument (`(fn [{:keys [s p o]}]) -> bool`, the exact same triple-map shape
`arrangement.query`/`bridge/q` already use) and applies it as a post-filter
over every candidate triple **before** it becomes a queryable RDF quad.
`(constantly true)` is a caller's explicit choice, never this repo's
default — there is no arity that omits it.

## Implemented subset (v0.1)

- `GET /sparql?query=<SPARQL text>` and `POST /sparql`.
  - **Primary POST form**: `Content-Type: application/sparql-query` — the
    entire body IS the query text, zero decoding ambiguity.
  - **Secondary POST form**: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with a
    `query` field — supported, with a real (UTF-8-correct, not byte-by-byte)
    percent-decoder.
  - GET's `:query` map is assumed already percent-decoded by the caller/
    deploy shell, matching `kotobase-protocols`' own `:query`/`http/
    query-param` convention.
- `Accept: application/sparql-results+json` (or `*/*`/absent, which default
  to JSON) — [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/)
  for both `SELECT` and `ASK`. Anything else gets `406 Not Acceptable` —
  **XML and CSV results formats are explicitly not implemented in v0.1**
  (per the task scope: "nice-to-have, not required").
- Query language subset: exactly what `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra
  supports — `PREFIX` declarations, `SELECT`(`DISTINCT`)/`ASK`, `WHERE {
  ... }` with triple patterns / `OPTIONAL` / `{ } UNION { }` / `FILTER`
  (`=` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`, `&&`, unary `!`, `BOUND(?v)`), `ORDER BY`,
  `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`. See `kotobase.protocols.sparql.parser`'s ns docstring
  for the precise grammar and its explicit non-goals (no property paths /
  `GRAPH` / `SERVICE` / aggregates / subqueries / predicate-object lists —
  `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra has none of these operators to translate
  into, so this parser doesn't either).
- `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE`/`UPDATE` are not implemented — no RDF-graph-out or
  write path in `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s algebra to wrap.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[kotobase.local :as local]
         '[kotobase.store :as st]
         '[kotobase.protocols.sparql :as sparql-protocol])

(def store (local/local-store))
(st/-put store "users" "u1" {:name "Alice" :role "admin" :dept-key "d1"})
(st/-put store "departments" "d1" {:name "Engineering"})

(def ctx {:store store
          :coll-keys ["users" "departments"]
          :visible? (constantly true)}) ; caller's explicit choice, see above

(sparql-protocol/handle
 ctx
 {:method :get
  :query {"query" "SELECT ?uname ?dname WHERE {
                     ?u <urn:kotobase:name> ?uname .
                     ?u <urn:kotobase:dept-key> ?dk .
                     ?d <urn:kotobase:kotobase/coll> \"departments\" .
                     ?d <urn:kotobase:kotobase/key> ?dk .
                     ?d <urn:kotobase:name> ?dname . }"}
  :headers {"accept" "application/sparql-results+json"}})
;;=> {:status 200
;;    :headers {"content-type" "application/sparql-results+json"}
;;    :body "{\"head\":{\"vars\":[\"uname\",\"dname\"]},\"results\":{\"bindings\":[{\"uname\":{\"type\":\"literal\",\"value\":\"Alice\"},\"dname\":{\"type\":\"literal\",\"value\":\"Engineering\"}}]}}"}
```

`:coll-keys` is the fixed set of `kotobase.store` collections this endpoint
exposes as its RDF dataset — there is no per-request dataset selection
(SPARQL's own `default-graph-uri`/`named-graph-uri` protocol params are out
of scope, matching `kotoba-lang/sparql`'s own no-named-graphs boundary).

## Scope guards (read before extending)

- **v0.1 re-materializes on every request** — no caching, same linear-scan
  limitation `kotobase.query.bridge/materialize` itself documents. This
  handler adds no caching on top of it. Real incremental indexing is a
  follow-up once there is real query-volume evidence, not a v0.1
  requirement (ADR-2607172300).
- **`FILTER`'s `=`/`!=`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` compare terms' `:value` only** —
  an IRI and a literal that happen to share the same string `:value` would
  compare equal. Given this repo's own quad transform never emits an
  object-position IRI, this does not arise in practice for BGP-produced
  bindings, but is stated here rather than left implicit.
- **`ORDER BY DESC(...)` is accepted syntactically but sorts ascending** —
  `sparql.core`'s `:order-by` node has no direction flag. `parser/parse`
  surfaces this in a `:warnings` vector rather than silently reversing
  nothing, so a caller can choose to surface it.
- **No predicate-object lists** (`s p o1 , o2`) or **property lists**
  (`s p1 o1 ; p2 o2`) — one `s p o .` triple per statement.
- **`kotobase.protocols.sparql.json`** is a small vendored copy of
  `kotobase-protocols`' `json.cljc` `encode` pattern (encode-only — nothing
  in this protocol's request path is JSON to parse), not a code dependency
  on that repo. ADR-2607172300's dependency table for this repo lists
  exactly `kotoba-lang/sparql` + `kotoba-lang/kotobase-query`;
  `kotobase-protocols` is this effort's wire-protocol-handler STYLE
  reference, not a dependency of this repo.

## Dependencies

- [`kotoba-lang/sparql`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/sparql) — the SPARQL
  algebra (`sparql.core/select`, `sparql.core/ask`) this repo wraps, as-is.
- [`kotoba-lang/kotobase-query`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase-query) —
  `kotobase.query.bridge/materialize`, the `IStore` → `arrangement.core` db
  bridge this repo's own `kotobase.protocols.sparql.quads` walks.
  Transitively pulls in `kotoba-lang/kotobase` (`IStore`/`LocalStore`),
  `kotoba-lang/arrangement` (the 4-covering index + its `commit!`/CID-
  snapshot machinery, unused by this repo but required at namespace-load
  time), and in turn `prolly-tree`/`io-ipld`/`io-multiformats`/
  `org-ietf-cbor` — see `kotobase-query`'s own README for why. `deps.edn`'s
  two direct git deps resolve that whole chain automatically for the JVM
  `:test` alias via `tools.deps`; the nbb primary test path has no
  dependency resolver, so `bin/run_tests.cljs`/CI clone every transitive dep
  by hand.
- npm `@noble/hashes` — transitive JS-runtime dep of `io-multiformats`,
  same as `kotobase-query`'s own `package.json`.

## Develop / test

First-class runtime is **nbb/cljs** (repo-wide runtime priority):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/sparql .deps/sparql
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase-query .deps/kotobase-query
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase .deps/kotobase
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/arrangement .deps/arrangement
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/prolly-tree .deps/prolly-tree
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/io-ipld .deps/io-ipld
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/io-multiformats .deps/io-multiformats
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-ietf-cbor .deps/org-ietf-cbor
npm install
nbb --classpath "src:test:.deps/sparql/src:.deps/kotobase-query/src:.deps/kotobase/src:.deps/arrangement/src:.deps/prolly-tree/src:.deps/io-ipld/src:.deps/io-multiformats/src:.deps/org-ietf-cbor/src" bin/run_tests.cljs
```

Each `.deps/<name>` should be checked out at the SHA pinned in `deps.edn`
(`sparql`, `kotobase-query`) or transitively (the rest) — CI pins every one
of them, see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The `:test` alias in `deps.edn` is the JVM **compat** suite only (`clojure
-M:test`, via `tools.deps` transitive git-dep resolution — no manual
`.deps/` cloning needed for this path) — not the primary execution path.
`clojure -M:lint` runs `clj-kondo`.

## CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE return a graph, not a table

`SELECT`/`ASK` answer a solution table as `application/sparql-results+json`.
`CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` answer an RDF **graph**, which that format has no way to
express — so they answer **N-Triples** (`application/n-triples`).

```
CONSTRUCT { ?u <urn:kotobase:isNamed> ?n } WHERE { ?u <urn:kotobase:name> ?n }
DESCRIBE <urn:kotobase:users/u1>
DESCRIBE ?u WHERE { ?u <urn:kotobase:role> "admin" }
```

**Content negotiation depends on the form, not just the header.** Asking for
`sparql-results+json` with a `CONSTRUCT` is a 406, not a graph mislabelled as a
solution table; asking for N-Triples with a `SELECT` is a 406 too. A request
with no `Accept` gets whichever single format its form has.

N-Triples rather than Turtle or RDF/XML: it is a required serialization in the
protocol, it is line-oriented so a large graph streams and diffs, and it needs
no prefix bookkeeping so there is nothing to get wrong between writer and
reader. Output is sorted, because the input is a set and two identical graphs
should serialize identically — the determinism is for whoever diffs it, not
part of RDF's meaning.

`DESCRIBE` returns the **subject triples**, not the Concise Bounded Description
the spec permits: CBD follows blank nodes and there is no blank-node syntax
here to follow. The spec leaves the shape implementation-defined so a service
can say which one it returns.
