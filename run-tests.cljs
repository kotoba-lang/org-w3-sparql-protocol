  "The suite under ClojureScript.

  The SPARQL protocol handler the lake Worker supplies a prefetched source to.

  This repo had no ClojureScript entry, so the murakumo fleet could only
  gate its JVM half. Counts were measured to match before this was added --
  that measurement, not the `.cljc` extension, is what earns a second gate.
  Measured 2026-08-17 on datom-source: a portable suite can be green on the
  JVM and red under nbb for reasons production does not have (SCI deftype
  behaviour), so `.cljc` alone is not grounds.

      npx nbb --classpath src:test run-tests.cljs"
