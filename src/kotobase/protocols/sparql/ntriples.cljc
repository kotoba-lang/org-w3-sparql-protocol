  "RDF 1.1 N-Triples serialization for CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE results.

  CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE return a GRAPH, not a solution table, so
  `application/sparql-results+json` does not apply to them — that format has no
  way to say \"these are triples\". N-Triples is the RDF format to reach for
  first: it is a REQUIRED serialization in the SPARQL 1.1 protocol, it is
  line-oriented so a large graph streams and diffs, and it needs no prefix
  bookkeeping, so there is nothing to get wrong between the writer and a
  reader.

  Turtle would be smaller and RDF/XML more traditional. Neither is implemented,
  and this namespace does not pretend to negotiate: the handler answers 406 for
  anything else rather than sending N-Triples under another content type."
